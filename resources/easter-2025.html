        <p>He is risen! Easter is the most victorious celebration in the Christian calendarâ€”Jesus' victory over death, the fulfillment of God's promise, and the beginning of new life for all believers. As we approach Easter 2025, it's time to prepare our hearts, commemorate the hope of the Resurrection, and interact with Scripture in a way that's both meaningful and fun.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-manna-black"><p>What Is Easter?</p></h2><p>Easter Sundayâ€”April 20, 2025â€”commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, three days after His crucifixion. It is the focal point of the Christian faith, the ultimate sign that sin and death will not prevail. In Jesus, we are given the gift of eternal life.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-manna-black"><p>Why Do We Celebrate Easter?</p></h2><p>Easter is more than a date on the calendarâ€”it's the cornerstone of Christian faith. As St. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15:17, "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile." But He has been raisedâ€”and everything is different because of it.</p><p>We celebrate because:</p><ul>
        <li>Jesus conquered sin and death.</li>
        </ul><ul>
        <li>We're given new life and hope.</li>
        </ul><ul>
        <li>It's a reminder that love prevails.</li>
        </ul><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-manna-black"><p>How to Pray and Reflect on Easter 2025</p></h2><p>There are many ways to greet this holy season, says Hallow's Easter prayer guide.
