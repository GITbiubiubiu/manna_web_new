        <p>As Lent begins, Ash Wednesday marks the first day on a 40-day journey of spirituality leading us to Easter. To some Christians, however, today isn't so much about getting ashes smudged on our foreheads—it's a moment of tremendous authority in which to take a halt, reboot, and renew our hearts to God. But suppose embracing God through Lent could be uplifting, even festive?</p><p>At Manna, we don't believe that faith needs to hold you back. Through our gamified Bible study app, you can spend time in the Scriptures daily, earn badges, keep streaks, and even take quizzes that make reading the Bible enjoyable and easy.</p><p>Let's dive in a little deeper about Ash Wednesday—what it is, why it matters, and how you can level up your faith this Lent on Manna.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-manna-black"><p>What Is Ash Wednesday?</p></h2><p><strong>Ash Wednesday</strong> marks the start of Lent, a season of prayer, fasting, and almsgiving to lead us up to Easter. It is the day that individuals all across the world attend mass where they have ashes imposed on their foreheads in the shape of a cross. It is an ancient practice reminding us of our own mortality and reliance on God's mercy.</p><p>The ashes are typically made up of palms that were burned from last <strong>Palm Sunday</strong>, and the priest or minister will say, "Remember you are dust, and to dust you shall return," or "Repent, and believe in the Gospel."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-manna-black"><p>Why Do Christians Celebrate Ash Wednesday?</p></h2><p>Ash Wednesday isn't about ritual alone—it's about real change. It's an invitation to spiritual renewal. It's about:</p><ul>
        <li>Repentance – Turning away from sin and turning back to God.</li>
        </ul><ul>
        <li>Reflection – Examining our hearts and making space for God.</li>
        </ul><ul>
        <li>Preparation – Starting the journey to Easter with purpose.</li>
        </ul><p>Lent is modeled after Jesus' 40 days in the desert, where He fasted, prayed, and stood firm against temptation. Just like Jesus, we're invited to a season of intentional living—and Ash Wednesday is our launch point.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-manna-black"><p>What Are the Traditions of Ash Wednesday?</p></h2><p>Here are some traditions that are practiced:</p><ul>
        <li>Fasting – Adults typically fast or eat less on Ash Wednesday (and Fridays during Lent).</li>
        </ul><ul>
        <li>Not Eating Meat – Most Christians refrain from eating meat as a form of penance.</li>
        </ul><ul>
        <li>Getting Ashes – Attending a church service and receiving ashes is the most visible tradition.</li>
        </ul><ul>
        <li>Prayer and Reading the Bible – Spending more time with God.</li>
        </ul><p>Whether you've been following these traditions for years or just starting out, what matters most is the heart behind it. And the good news is: you don't have to do it alone.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-manna-black"><p>Make Lent More Meaningful (and Fun!) with Manna</p></h2><p>Let's be real—starting strong on Ash Wednesday is great, but maintaining consistently throughout Lent can be tough.
