        <p>The Catholic Church has a long history of formalizing doctrine and developing resources to help individuals grow in the faith. Catholic prayers and creeds are especially helpful in learning important teachings and growing in your spiritual walk.</p>
        
        <p>Over the centuries, ministry leaders and friends of the Church have created guiding <a href="https://www.themanna.app/prayers">prayer </a> templates—a few are included in this article. In most cases, the prayers are not specifically Catholic Prayers—that is, for Catholics only—they are helps for all who desire to share needs, concerns, and praises to God.</p>
        
        <p>Prayer and personal study (discipleship) are essential keys to growing in the faith. The Catholic Prayers are organized (below) by category. We encourage you to use these sample prayers as a guide and personalize or customize them as you feel led. Remember, God is more concerned with your heart than your words. Pray with sincerity, with passion, and with precision. Pray often, and utilize the <a href="https://www.themanna.app/download">Manna App</a> resource to maximize efforts to grow in your spiritual walk.</p>

          <h2>3. Sample Catholic Prayers for Discernment and Wisdom</h2>
          <p>These guiding Catholic prayers are well-suited for those seeking guidance, clarification, and wisdom from the Lord.</p>
          
          <h3><strong>A Prayer for Wisdom and Peace When Making Big Decisions</strong></h3>
          <p>Dear heavenly Father, you number our hairs and determine our days; you hang the stars and feed the sparrows; you open doors no one can shut and shut doors no one can open. Surely, we can trust you when the time comes for making big decisions, or for that matter, any decisions.</p>
          
          <p>We are in just such a season again, Father, and we know we are not alone. We will trust you for generous wisdom, straight paths, and peaceful hearts, all for your glory.</p>
          
          <p>How we praise you for being the decision-making-God. It's not our decisions, but Yours that make all the difference. We will plan, but we trust You to order our steps. We will pray, but ask you to fix our prayers en route to heaven.</p>
          
          <h3><strong>Deep Listening</strong></h3>
          <p>God of silence and God of all sound, help me to listen. Help me to do the deep listening to the sounds of my soul, waiting to hear your soft voice calling me deeper into you.</p>
          
          <p>Give me attentive ears that begin to separate the noise from the sounds that are You; You who have been speaking to me and through me my whole life, for so long that you can seem like background noise. Today, help me hear You anew.</p>
          
          <h3><strong>Help Me To Discern</strong></h3>
          <p>Today, O God of all days, give me an experience of your heart. Draw me deep into your very being, into the core of your love for me, others, and the world.</p>
          
          <p>Give me a glimpse of others the way you see others: loving them, forgiving them, and delighting in the way they give glory to God through their very existence.</p>
          
          <p>Help me to discern out of that open place of deep affection so that I too might be a useful vessel of your love in the world.</p>
