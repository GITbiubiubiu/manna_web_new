          <p>The Catholic Church has a long history of formalizing doctrine and developing resources to help individuals grow in the faith. Catholic prayers and creeds are especially helpful in learning important teachings and growing in your spiritual walk.</p>
          
          <p>Over the centuries, ministry leaders and friends of the Church have created guiding prayer templates—a few are included in this article. In most cases, the prayers are not specifically Catholic Prayers—that is, for Catholics only—they are helps for all who desire to share needs, concerns, and praises to God.</p>
          
          <p>Prayer and personal study (discipleship) are essential keys to growing in the faith. The Catholic Prayers are organized (below) by category. We encourage you to use these sample prayers as a guide and personalize or customize them as you feel led. Remember, God is more concerned with your heart than your words. Pray with sincerity, with passion, and with precision. Pray often, and utilize the Manna App resource to maximize efforts to grow in your spiritual walk.</p>

              <h3>Penance</h3>
              <p><em>My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart. In choosing to do wrong, and failing to do good, I have sinned against you whom I should love above all things.</em></p>
              
              <p><em>I firmly intend, with your help, to do penance, to sin no more, and avoid whatever leads me to sin. Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us. In His name, my God, have mercy.</em></p>
