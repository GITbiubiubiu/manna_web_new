      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-manna-black">I. Introduction: The Importance of Studying God's Word</h2>
      <p>The Bible is unique and wonderful. It is one of God's great gifts to humanity. It is divinely inspired, has been perfectly preserved, and serves as our best defense against the enemy, who "roams about like a roaring lion, seeking those whom he may devour" (1 Peter 5:8).</p>
      
      <p>There are many reasons that followers of Christ should engage in Bible study. The study of Scripture provides direction, understanding, peace, insight, hope, and help to stand against the enemy; most of all, involvement in Bible study draws one into a close relationship with God.</p>
      
      <p>Why should believers invest time and energy in Bible study? Because the Bible is a living book—comprised of divinely inspired words of penetrating power—words that touch heart and soul—words that can change and save lives—words that never lose their meaning or potency. Through Bible study, one learns more about who God is, who we are, and our spiritual need. The Manna App can be a valuable resource in this endeavor.</p>
      
      <p>The Bible is a love story. In page after page, we see God helping, giving, loving, sacrificing, and taking the initiative to demonstrate His affection. The love story culminates in Jesus' sacrificial death at Calvary, in which He, Emmanuel, "God with us," died for us so that we could live with Him, in His kingdom, forever.</p>
      
      <p>Bible study provides one with confidence in the integrity and potency of the Word, and elevates one's witness as they share and defend the Word. The prophetic dynamic of the Word is unparalleled. More than 900 prophecies were to have been fulfilled by this point in history—and they have, exactly as foretold. Though Bible prophecy is extremely precise (such as the Messiah would be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver, or that he would be crucified and pierced and scourged, and that none of his bones would be broken), the accuracy rating for Bible prophecy is perfect—100%. Many "sacred writings" in world religions present prophecies, but none can match the Bible's accuracy or precision. Through Bible study—particularly a study of Bible prophecy, God reveals His sovereignty, power, and love. The fulfillment of Bible prophecy provides empirical proof that Scripture is not only accurate but also divinely inspired and should be viewed as the supreme source of truth and authority.</p>
      
      <p>Over 100 million Bibles are sold yearly, yet strangely, few know very much about God's Word. The Manna App can help individuals deepen their faith and foster spiritual growth. Why is this important? Because Scripture encourages believers to "study" the Word (2 Tim. 2:15), "examine" the Word (Acts 17:11), "hide the Word" in our hearts (Psa. 119:11), and be able to give a "defense" for the truth in God's Word (1 Pet. 3:15). Engaging in Bible study will help you fulfill your calling as a believer—the Manna App will too.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-manna-black">II. Developing a Bible Study Habit</h2>
      <p>Most have a desire to study the Bible and learn more about God's grace and power, but struggle to know how or where to start. We are happy to provide a few suggestions:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Establish a routine:</strong> Schedule time for study, meditation, and reflection. Most people carry busy schedules, and the truth is that if we don't schedule it, it won't become a regular part of our lifestyle. Start with manageable goals and increase on a monthly basis (or less if possible). Consider setting aside 20-30 minutes a day to begin. This may sound like a lofty goal, but the more you invest, the more you will receive.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Find a peaceful place:</strong> The Bible notes that Jesus went out to solitary places for prayer and reflection. Find a place that has minimal distractions. Turn off the phone, inform others in the home that you wish not to be disturbed for the next X minutes (unless an important issue arises), and as possible, have someone watch the kids or pets or tend to whatever may cause an unnecessary interruption. Scripture notes that "If we seek Him, we will find Him, when we seek Him with all our heart" (Jer. 29:12-13). Prioritize focusing on Him with all your heart.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Begin with prayer:</strong> Spend time thanking God for His blessings, intercede for others, and ask for insight (and for Him to speak to you) as you study His word.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Have a plan:</strong> We do not recommend opening the Bible and beginning to read from the random page you happen to open. Certainly, all of the Bible is good, inspired, and profitable for reading; however, a systematic study plan is best suited for those who want to study the Bible and maximize their time in the Word. Therefore, we recommend reading through a book (a chapter at a time), or following one of the many read through the Bible plans that are available online, or reading about a particular character or happening (such as the missionary journeys of Paul, the life of Abraham, the Exodus, etc.). We believe it is best to read with purpose and focus. For example, one may decide to read through the book of Proverbs this month or learn about the events associated with the birth of the New Testament Church by reading the book of Acts.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Keep a journal:</strong> It is normal (and good) to have questions. Jot them down in a journal as you read, then pray for discernment, look up answers in good books, and on reputable sites.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Utilize the Manna App:</strong> The resources, study helps, and suggestions will help you deepen your spiritual walk and increase your understanding of spiritual precepts.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Consider getting a prayer/study partner and connecting with a good ministry leader:</strong> Share your study goals, questions, and prayer requests with these people.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-manna-black">III. Practical Steps for Studying the Bible</h2>
      <p>It is wise to have a good game plan as you study the Bible, and it is good to incorporate variety in your study routine. There is no one right way to pray or study, but there are study methods that have proven to be beneficial. Several are noted below:</p>
      
      <h3><strong>Topical Studies</strong></h3>
      <p>Many prayerfully consider what topics they should learn about over the next 3-6 months (and then reevaluate after that study focus is complete). Topics could include How and why one should witness, the nature and role of the Holy Spirit, the deity of Christ, the ministry of Christ, the sayings/miracles/teachings of Jesus, the Trinity, the minor prophets, the major prophets, the Exodus, the Exile, the building of the first Temple, the birth and expansion of the New Testament Church, prophecy/eschatology, prayer, the Beatitudes, biblical marriage, biblical finances, and biblical keys for communication and relationships.</p>
      
      <h3><strong>Book Studies</strong></h3>
      <p>Reading through a book of the Bible is always profitable, but remember, some of the books are designed to be read together. For example, it is good to read the Gospels together, some of the history books (such as First/Second Kings, First/Second Samuel, and First/Second Chronicles) together, the writings of Moses (such as Exodus, Deuteronomy, and Numbers) together, the Epistles of Paul (such as Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians) together, the Minor Prophets (such as Joel, Jonah, Micah, and Malachi) together, etc. We also suggest that before you begin reading a book, do a little background study to learn about the author, and when/where/why/to whom it was written. This foundational information helps make the study of Scripture come to life.</p>
      
      <h3><strong>Character Studies</strong></h3>
      <p>There are many fascinating characters in Scripture—we can learn from the good and bad decisions they made. You may want to study a person who was mentioned in the Church or in a story you read. You may want to look in the back of your Bible to see if there is a dictionary, appendix, or concordance that includes the names of notable characters and where their information can be found in the Bible. Online searches can be helpful too. For example, a quick Google of Joseph and you'll find that his story is profiled in Genesis chapters 37-50.</p>
      
      <h3><strong>Utilizing Study Tools</strong></h3>
      <p>This can seem overwhelming, but many study the Bible by using different study tools. Software programs (for example, Logos and the Manna App) include many study features to help individuals learn about particular topics, prepare lessons, or delve into deeper subjects such as apologetics. Less robust options include Study Bibles (which have commentary notes that explain or expound on key passages appear near the text), and Bible Dictionaries, Concordances, Commentaries, Encyclopedias, Thesauruses, and Word Study Books (all of which can help the reader learn about key factors that impact the interpretation of the text).</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-manna-black">Apply the Word</h2>
      <p>Scripture notes that The sons of Issachar were wise, because they understood the times and knew what to do (2 Chron. 12:32). Sharing in regular Bible study helps individuals not just be informed and encouraged but also equipped to live a life marked by honor, happiness, and purpose. The goal, then, is not just to know the Word, but also to be able to apply the Word. That's part of what the Apostle Paul alludes to in 2 Timothy 2:15 (being able to handle the Word of truth), and part of the vision of the Manna App.</p>
      
      <p>Fortunately, we who live at this time in history have access to many free and low-cost study aids to help us understand and apply His Word. For example, Life Application Study Bibles and similar themed Bible reading companion books can help individuals not only understand the meaning of key passages but also learn how to apply timeless spiritual precepts in their lives today. And Bible Study Apps and application tools such as the Manna App, Got Questions, and Bible Hub are great resources too.</p>
      
      <p>God knows life can be very challenging and has provided resources to help individuals navigate the complex issues that arise in modern culture. Scripture offers insight into spiritual themes such as heaven, hell, and angels, while also providing a wealth of information on practical life management topics, including the stewardship of finances, stress management, battling depression, maintaining relationships, finding purpose, facing fears, and cultivating contentment, among others. Those who engage in Bible study often discover wonderful, timeless principles that help them make wise daily decisions and overcome difficult circumstances.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-manna-black">IV. Overcoming Common Challenges</h2>
      <p>Challenges will arise when you commit to becoming a student of the Word. Remember, the enemy is real, "roams about," and does NOT want you to study God's Word. A list of challenges that those who participate in Bible study often experience (and recommendations) follows:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Time management issues:</strong> The enemy will whisper, You don't have time to study today. Consider this counsel and perspective from George Mueller, a renowned 19th-century pastor, missionary, and evangelist who lived an incredibly productive life. When a friend asked if there were days when he just did not have time to pray or study, he replied: "I look upon it as a lost day when I have not had a good time over the Word of God." It may take some time before studying the Bible is a habit and part of your regular routine, but once it is, you will realize that God somehow multiplies the time for those who invest their time wisely.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Difficulty understanding the text:</strong> The Bible was written in lands far away, a long time ago, in other languages, and in a different cultural context. If you heard someone say, "I'm really into Football. I don't think the Bears will make it to the Super Bowl this year, but if they do, I'm catching the Red Eye out of the Windy City to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara to watch the game." Most today could follow that conversation, but what about people who lived in America just 150 years ago? What if we interpreted the language into Hebrew and somehow relayed it to people who lived in the first century AD? They may understand some of the words, but not the meaning. So, understanding Scripture requires study, and studying the Bible makes phrases such as the third watch, the widow's mite, or being paid a denarius for a day's wages come to life. Bible study heightens understanding of important terms and phrases.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Expect it to be challenging:</strong> Becoming a skilled musician, painter, or athlete does not just happen—it requires great effort, practice, and sacrifice. Even those who are musically or athletically inclined must work hard to excel in their craft. The same is true for those who study the Bible. You may love God, but becoming one who has "shown themselves approved…as one who can correctly handle [interpret and share] the word of truth" (2 Timothy 2:15) requires significant effort. However, resources such as the Manna App can make the pursuit of Bible knowledge exciting and enjoyable.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Expect opposition:</strong> The enemy will likely try to derail your study plans and efforts. He is wise and crafty. Expect challenges, but remain committed to persevering and pushing through. Don't give up and do not tie how you feel that day to your decision regarding whether or not to study that day. Be faithful. Be persistent.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Apparent contradictions and discrepancies:</strong> There are many apparent errors in the Bible, but an apparent error is not an error, and all can be resolved with a little study. For example, there seems to be a contradiction between John 19:14 and Mark 15:25. One Gospel writer notes that Jesus was crucified at the 'sixth' hour, and another notes that it was the 'third' hour. This apparent contradiction is easily resolved when we understand that one Gospel writer is using a Roman system of timekeeping, while the other is referencing a Hebrew system. This is the same as noting Noon, 12:00 PM, or 1400 hours. Study Bibles and support books such as The Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties by Gleason L. Archer and Bible Difficulties Solved by Larry Richards are fine, inexpensive resources.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-manna-black">V. Encouragement to Persist</h2>
      <p>Studying Scripture is a noble pursuit. There will be challenges—don't give up. Remember that consistency leads to transformation. Push through, ask questions, seek answers, and connect with others who share your passion. Consider engaging in both small group studies and personal Bible study efforts.</p>
      
      <p>Yes, studying the Bible pleases God, but it will also encourage and equip you. Life can be difficult, and the enemy is on the prowl. Those who study the Bible will sharpen their mind and learn how to utilize "the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God." The sword will help keep the enemy at bay, and God's truth will help you live the "abundant life" Jesus spoke of in John 10:10.</p>
